_

2. What is the storyline of your application?
You fall asleep ad go into a "dream" where your favorite pendent was stolen and you have to get it back by battling all the monsters there are.
 You have a few moves which you can use and evolve based on your points.
 You have to finish the level before your HP bar runs out and it will replenish every level.
 At the end you finish all the level and will get a souvenier from every boss you fought.
 When you wake up (after finishing all the 5 levels), you find not only you pendant neckalce at your nightstand, but also the 5 Souvenirs - proving the dream to actually be reality.
